## Uncontinued Projects due to professional goals

On the First looking I tought would be a good idea to make my GitHub Contributions Dots as a **LED SCREEN**...
But after a few weeks on this project I realized GitHub is a tool to show people my Stats on Programming,
and at This **LED PROJECT** I Would mess all my Contribution Stats, and thats not an Acchivement right now.

Maybe we continue this other year haha

Ps:Now closing this I realized that would be nice to write which songs I was listenning to while doing the Projects, to have another Human Detail on, idk... why not? haha

Ps2: CLosing this Project Listenning "The Weeknd - Blinding Lights (Live On The 2020 MTV VMAs)" üò≥ü§ùüòéüëç
